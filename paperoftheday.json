[{"title":"Auto-Lambda: Disentangling Dynamic Task Relationships","link":"https://paperswithcode.com/paper/auto-lambda-disentangling-dynamic-task","description":"Unlike previous methods where task relationships are assumed to be fixed, Auto-Lambda is a gradient-based meta learning framework which explores continuous, dynamic task relationships via task-specific weightings, and can optimise any choice of combination of tasks through the formulation of a meta-loss; where the validation loss automatically influences task weightings throughout training.","date":"2/9/2022"}]
